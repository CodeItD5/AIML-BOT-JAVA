# AIML-BOT-JAVA

- AIML refers to Artificial Intelligence Markup Language
- This is a small project to create chat bot using JAVA
- I have used AIML from https://code.google.com/archive/p/program-ab/downloadshttps://code.google.com/archive/p/program-ab/downloads
- Then I created a maven project in IntelliJ idea 
- From the AIML zip that I downloaded before, I took Ab.jar and pasted it under lib directory, that is on same hierarchy as src 
- I created one resources directory under which I pasted the bots directory from the AIML zip that was downloaded before 
- For better understanding of AIML: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/05/aiml-a-language-for-chatbots/
- This chatbot will run as usual terminal based application once the App.java class is executed.
